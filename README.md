LLM App made using [LangChain Framework](#langchain-framework) for Custom Data

## LangChain Framework

LangChain is an open-source framework designed to simplify the creation of applications using large language models (LLMs). It provides a standardized interface, prompt management, and external integrations, making it easier for developers to leverage LLMs for a variety of natural language processing tasks. LangChain follows a general pipeline where a user interacts with the language model, which utilizes its vector database and other components to generate responses.

### Key Features

LangChain offers a wide range of features and capabilities for developers:

- Off-the-shelf chains: LangChain provides pre-built chains for common applications.
- Component library: Customize existing chains and build new ones using a library of modular components.
- Memory module: Enhance an LLM's capability to remember and contextualize interactions.
- External integrations: Easily integrate LangChain with external sources of computation and data.

### Applications

LangChain is a versatile framework that can be used to develop various LLM-powered applications, including:

- Document analysis and summarization.
- Chatbots: Create natural and interactive chatbots for customer assistance and more.
- Code analysis: Analyze code for potential bugs and security vulnerabilities.
- Question answering using sources: Answer questions by searching through diverse sources like text, code, and data.
- Data augmentation: Generate new data similar to existing data for training machine learning models.
- Text classification: Perform text classifications and sentiment analysis.
- Text summarization: Summarize text to a specified length.
- Machine translation: Translate text into different languages.

### Key Concepts

LangChain is built around the following key concepts:

- **Components**: These are modular building blocks, including LLM Wrappers, Prompt Templates, and Indexes, designed for easy application development.
- **Chains**: Chains combine components to solve specific tasks, offering a modular approach to building complex applications.
- **Agents**: Agents enable LLMs to interact with their environment, including external APIs for performing specific actions.

LangChain is a powerful and adaptable framework that is continually evolving and supported by a dedicated community of users and contributors. Start using [LangChain](https://langchain.io) to enhance your natural language processing applications with large language models.
